First Project - Recipes

Odin lesson didn't offer much help with the Git Commit. 
I was worried about doing this from memory and had to piece together from the previous lesson.
This was probably designed this way. 

Had to navigate to directory that I was working in, then track status of project
with 'git status' , then 'git add' each file or folder in project.
Finally 'git commit -m "Comments about specific commit' and then 'git push' to upload to Git Hub.

Struggled with getting stupid cookie image to load, forget second period on the img tag
use ../foldername/filename. DUMB lol. 

Silly project, but made me feel good to breeze through something and have a tangible result.
